# Veridic

> Truthful compliance automation - straight from your infrastructure.

Veridic is a CLI-first compliance tool for engineers and startups. It pulls real-time configuration data from your cloud environments and maps it to controls from frameworks like SOC2 and ISO27001. No more screenshots, spreadsheets, or stale policies — just evidence you can trust.
